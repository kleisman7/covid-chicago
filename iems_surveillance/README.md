# IEMS_surveillance

new model steps:
scripts up to step 5 are fully tested  
need new .sh to run all code successively (all_run.sh is for old model, but can be used as a referenced for new .sh)   

- 1 run covid model with/without mitigation (no script here)
- 2 grab data series: daily new mild symptomatics
- 3 downsample to generate survaillance data
- 4 evaluate Rt
- 5 make decision
- 6 + 1 pick up saved model and run simulations
- 7 measure ICU admission and deaths
